TODO
- automate gathering the inputs from the aix machine (includes, libs)
- automate building the libgcc1.a on the aix machine
- double check the process for libgcc1.a
- explore fakeroot so we don't need root perms at all or at least make the build 
   part of the build not use them
- document the requirements on the host machine we're running this on and on the 
   aix machine for the steps that happen there
- figure out how to avoid having to manually fix 2.95.3 generated headers mid 
   build; clean up the old gcc-lib includes patch
- try to make the gcc version handling less piecemeal, and add a better way to 
   specify than editing go.sh
- fix the prefix used for the far compiler build so we get a more comprehensible
   search path for override headers than the current /root/opt/far
