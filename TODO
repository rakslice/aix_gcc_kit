TODO
- investigate cross binutils (binutils-far.sh, haven't looked at that one yet)
- automate gathering the inputs from the aix machine (includes, libs)
- automate building the libgcc1.a on the aix machine
- figure out if we can git rid of the gcc-lib includes patch in the middle of the process by just making changes to the gcc source
