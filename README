A kit for cross building gcc-2.7.2.3 for aix ps/2 using red hat linux 5.0.5 (which also has 2.7.2.3)

Steps

1. Get the required exports (headers, libs) from the aix machine.
dd in the disks to disk images. This will give you the aixinclude.dsk and
aixlib{1,2}.dsk files. Put them in the current directory.

2. Put the gcc-2.7.2.3 source on the aix machine and build libgcc1.a.
Put the libgcc1.a into the current directory.

3. Mount the rh 5.0.5 cdrom in /mnt/cdrom (or edit the cdrom= variable
at the top of create_chroot.sh if you have it at a different path).

4. Run ./go.sh  It will do the build and put the resulting build directory
into the disk images crossnative{1,2,3}.dsk

5. Extract the disk images on the aix system and run make install in the build directory


Scripts and pieces

./go.sh [options] - do the build
    Options (max 1)
    -c  - pop a shell in the rh5 cdrom chroot used to prepare the rh5 install 
    -f {filename} - find_in_cdrom.sh run: try to find an rpm the rh5 cdrom with a file matching a given pattern
    -d  - pop a shell in the rh5 install chroot before the build
./cleanup_chroots - cleanup any mounted chroot directories, for when a run stopped unsafely
./reset.sh - clean up all the extracted/intermediate files including the chroots
